## Loading and preprocessing the data
First we'll need to unzip the file to make the data accessible.
``` {r}
walk <- unzip('activity.zip')
```

And now we'll need to get the file loaded for analysis.
I'll also convert the date column to the date class.

``` {r}
walk <- read.csv('activity.csv',header=TRUE,as.is=TRUE)
walk$date=as.Date(walk$date,format='%Y-%m-%d')
```
And now we should be good to go.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
